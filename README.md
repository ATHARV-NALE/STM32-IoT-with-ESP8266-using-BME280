The objective of this project was to design and implement an IoT-based environmental monitoring system using the STM32 microcontroller, ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, and BME280 sensor. The system aimed to measure temperature, humidity, and pressure in real-time and transmit the data to a cloud server for remote monitoring. Embedded firmware was developed to read sensor data using I2C communication, process it, and send it to the ESP8266 via UART for Wi-Fi-based data transfer. This project demonstrates integration between sensors, microcontrollers, and IoT modules, enabling low-cost, reliable, and efficient environmental data acquisition and visualization through an online dashboard.
